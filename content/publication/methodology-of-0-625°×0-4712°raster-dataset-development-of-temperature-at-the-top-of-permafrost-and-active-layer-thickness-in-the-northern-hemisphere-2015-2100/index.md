abstract: "Understanding the spatial distribution and dynamics of current and
  future permafrost is critical for global carbon flow simulation, climate
  change prediction, and engineering risk assessment. The 0.625°x0.4712° raster
  dataset of temperature at the top of permafrost and active layer thickness in
  the northern hemisphere (2015-2100) was developed using the widely validated
  and applied Kudryavtsev method, which integrates the effects of temperature,
  snow, vegetation, and soil on permafrost, based on the model outputs from the
  sixth phase of the International Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6)
  and the SoilGrids 2.0 dataset. The data were calculated under four different
  scenarios, SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585, from 2015 to 2100. The
  permafrost area was obtained based on the temperature at the top of the
  permafrost. This dataset fills the gap in permafrost distribution data for the
  future under different scenarios for CMIP6. It includes the data covering
  2015-2100: (1) mean annual temperature at the top of the permafrost; (2)
  annual active layer thickness; and (3) annual permafrost area. The resolution
  of the spatial data is 0.625°x0.4712°. The dataset is archived in .tif and
  .xls data formats, and consists of 690 data files with data size of 35.6 MB
  (Compressed to one single file with 27.9 MB)."
